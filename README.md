# Assignment for week 7

I have chosen S1 vs S2 vs SEX vs (BMI or AGE or BP or Y) and S3 vs S4 vs SEX vs (BMI or AGE or BP or Y). 
The reasons I have chosen these are because from the relationship graph, I could see that there are strong 
correlation between S1 and S2 positively, and S3 and S4 (negatively). I have decided to keep the color chart 
representing sex, as there are only two option. I wanted to see whether S1, S2, S3 and S4 has other relationship
with either BMP, AGE, BP or Y.

Data points for most of other graphs are located in the center, looking like a ball, not showing any relationship
between them. However, seen from S3 vs S4 vs SEX vs Y, we can see that female tend to have higher S4 while lower S3
and better progree than male.
